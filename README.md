# Kaalka Package for Dart

* Based upon the Kaalka Encryption Algorithm

* Other developers can use your package by adding it as a dependency in their own Dart projects. They need to include the package name and version in their **pubspec.yaml** file:

```
dependencies:
  kaalka: ^1.0.0
```

Importing and Using: Once the package is added as a dependency, developers can import and use its classes, functions, and widgets in their Dart code:

```
import 'package:kaalka/kaalka.dart';

void main() {
  // Use classes, functions, or widgets from the kaalka package
  // ...
}
```
Using Widgets: If your package includes widgets, they can be used just like any other Flutter widgets in the user's UI code:

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:kaalka/kaalka.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: MyCustomWidget(), // Use the widget from your package
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
